Hangman game for Motorola Academy's recrutation/

Hello!
This task has proven to be quite a fun challenge.
Since You asked I am going to write a few words.
Around last year I graduated with bachelor degree in Asian Studies module Japan.
Since I did not plan to continue my studies in this field, I started looking for something else.
I started a short course in python in November 2020. Since it was quite fun I decided to pursue
programming as my line of work. Since then I've also completed a 7 months java course.
Motorola's Academy seem like a great way to not only further my programming knowledge,
but also to take the first steps in this proffesion.
To sum it up - programming is not just a professional matter to me. Although I am pursuing a
programmer career, I also find a lot of fun in coding.
Thank you for reading. Hopefully I will be hearing from You soon.
